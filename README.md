# Document Summarizer

### [Demo link](tinyurl.com/documentsummarizer)

React front-end / Spring Boot REST API app that takes an uploaded word document, PDF, text file, or pure text and generates a summary using a Python script and the Natural Language Toolkit.
As of now, I'm working on a more efficient/robust/concurrent text validation process, as well as a test automation script. The UI still needs a little work in terms of responsiveness and styling, but a fully functional version of the app is "complete" (until I decide to add more features).
